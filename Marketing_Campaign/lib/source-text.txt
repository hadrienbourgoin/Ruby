it's Quick overview
The Polish Opening is a rare opening that also goes by the names the Sokolsky Opening and the Orangutan Opening.
It arises after the move 1.b4, and White attempts to grab some queenside space and fianchetto the bishop to b2 on move two, in hopes of launching a long-range attack.
Black has several replies, with 1.d5 and 1.e5 being the most natural and popular as they grab control of the center and allow for easy development.
Despite being such a rare opening, it is not refuted and is very playable by both sides. Equal positions are likely to arise out of the opening.
